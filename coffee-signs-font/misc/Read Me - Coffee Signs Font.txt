I created the Coffee Signs font in a unique and very easy way to get curly swash & ligature. Hopefully, that way can help and speed up your time.

I use the ligature feature to make curly swash in front of letters and behind letters in words. You can access it by using double-asterisk (**) characters that are typed before the letters or after the letters to get a swash display.

For example, in the letter c & s, type **c for front swash or s** for back swash.

However, this ligature and swash feature will only be found on the Pro version which you can buy at my store link above.

For those of you who have used my font for commercial purposes and have previously purchased a license, hopefully your fortune will increase, your company will become more successful and your family will be happier.

Thank you very much. Let's support each other :)
